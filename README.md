These visualizations provide insight into the police office-civilian interactions in New York City from 2009 - 2016.  
Data comes from the [`NYC Open Data`](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) portal and the [`NYC Census`](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc-population/census2010/pgrhc.pdf).
